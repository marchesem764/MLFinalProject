    "Frame the Problem and Look at the Big Picture\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Define the objective in business terms.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this problem is to discover interesting trends in the world of competitive chess. FIDE will be focused on rather than national chess organizations because they have the toughest competition. FIDE is where who will be the next world champion is decided. We want to predict who the next world chess champion is going to be. We also want to figure out what the record for the highest ELO is going to be (whether it will break the current ceiling or not). We want to find out what chess players are trending in a good direction for breaking the current ceiling (setting a record) and becoming world champion. We also want to find out what countries will generate the next best players.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. How will your solution be used?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our solution can be used for a variety of ways from determining specific statistics and trends about current players to studying how players become better at chess overtime depending on age, gender and country of origin. Our dataset can be used by worldwide chess federations to determine how to grow and get better players.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What are the current solutions/workarounds (if any)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no currently existing solutions. There are however machine learning solutions for a computer to play chess. These solutions are highly effective and computers are extremely strong at chess. This could possibly help us if we applied this to analyzing games of different players to find trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. How should you frame this problem (supervised/unsupervised, online/offline, ...)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a supervised regression problem because we are using historical data to predict a continuous feature. The system should be offline as the data is only updated around every year. This could also be done as a classification problem because we are trying to figure out if someone will be world champion or not. However, the world champion is most likely just going to be the person with the highest rating. But this does not necessarily always need to be true, especially in the future. This part might be able to be classification if we create a second model that we feed the results of the first model (the one that predicts ELO) into.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. How should performance be measured? Is the performance measure aligned with the business objective?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance on the predicted ELO can be measured by measuring the mean square error of the predictions. Because this is a forecasting problem, we would take a window of our data instead of a test set. For the classification part, the performance can be measured by taking the accuracy of the predictions. The performance will definitely be aligned with our business objective since we want to accurately predict future ELO and accurately predict future world chess champions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. What would be the minimum performance needed to reach the business objective?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimum performance needed to reach the business objective could be subjected to the idea that we want our solution to be very accurate in at least placing players within a range of 10-20 rank for where they will be placed for coming years. If we can achieve accuracy where we can label what countries have the most prolific chess players and label what countries are achieving the most growth that would be a good place to start with the idea of minimum performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. What are comparable problems? Can you reuse experience or tools?**\n",
    "\n",
    "When jumping into this problem the first thing that came to my mind in terms of comparable problems was the housing income problem where we ultimately tried to discover interesting remarks about the housing income and prices in a specified area. Taking this into account we can look at how that problem can be somewhat comparable as we are taking individuals (houses) from specific countries (locations) and seeing what their value / skill is to the game of chess (price). Weather forecasting is also somewhat similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Is human expertise available?**\n",
    "Chess is a very popular hobby / sport in which millions of people take part in. There are tons of very good developers that have made projects similar to ours so that may be of use to us. There is human expertise in the form of chess grandmasters and commentators. They understand the players as people and they understand their playing styles. They can predict rank/world champion based on this criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. How would you solve the problem manually?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem could be solved manually by first finding out whether someone has peaked or not. If someone has peaked then they can be ruled out for increasing ELO or becoming world chess champion. Most younger players definitely have not peaked. This is the group that is the most interesting and promising for future world champions. We could find the fastest growing younger players and simply choose one of them as a candidate for future world championships.\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. List the assumptions you (or others) have made so far. Verify assumptions if possible.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The assumptions that we have made so far would include that all of the data provided is accurate and updated correctly. This includes players’ age, gender, ELO rating, country of origin and title.\n"
